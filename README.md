# Iteration and improvement of UI based on user feedback
After A2 was subitted and I wanted to iterate on my mock up designs for the final prototype, as i didnt have time to implement them befire the pitch presentation. I tested the site against 3 participants from grades Year 9-10. These tests were conducted individually. 

**Colour Scheme of UI**

Upon showing the participants the final prototype, I asked for their feedback on the overall aesthetic, information heirarchy and branding. 

Some notable quotes were:

1. "It's hard to read with this gradient"
2. "The colours make me think of a doctor's office"
3. "wow a lot of colour...Not sure where to look first"


This feedback motivated me to amend the colour scheme of the UI and enhance the information heirarchy. As colour was a notable take-away from the user testing sessions, I ensured this new colour scheme was clear, simple and adhered to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](http://web-accessibility.carnegiemuseums.org/design/color/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWCAG%20(Web%20Content%20Accessibility%20Guidelines,of%20at%20least%204.5%3A1)).

**Note-taking section removed**
When I got marks and feedback from A2, I implemented the feedback from tutor to refine the design. 

A notable piece of feedback was that the note-taking section was not a direct response to the design breif or user feedback. 

>"The note taking functionality looks like scope creep.
    Struggling to see the connection between note taking in this app and the user takeaways matrix. 
    The personas mentioned note taking as a goal but why does that need to be done in this app? "

Upon reflection, I agreed, and decided to omit that function from the final design. This also gave me more time to focus on the functionality of the other components in the Home and Apps page, as coding is not my strength.  



**Pomodoro Timer Functionality**
Around Week 10, I conducted a user testing session to test out the functionalities that had been coded so far.This included the pomodoro timer and task list functionality. Note the pomodoro timer was only coded to run for one session at this point. 

Using the 'think aloud protocol', I asked them to execute a set of task and for them to verbalise their thoughts and actions. After the session of testing out the site, I asked some reflective questions about the components and their features. I kept the questions open ended to remove bias in my language choice, and thus yield genuinine feedback (Jain 2020). 

Some notable takeaways were: 


1. All users selected the 25/5 pomodoro session. When asked why in the post-testing session, majority said they didn't feel the had the attention span for 50/10 sessions. Upon reflection, this aligned with my user research and fit with the design brief more. I kept the pomodoro timer simple with just the option for 25/5. 

2. Navigating the buttons for the pomodoro timer and all components of the task list took alot of time - buttons had a low affordability. I decided to up the contrast of the buttons and create less clicks in each execution pathway to reduce the time it takes for the user to reach their goal.

# Relevance to the Design Brief 


**One column in Kanban Board**

As justified in A2, I decided to keep the Kanban Board to only one column and the study session to 2 hours. This was a design decision directly from user research, to assign a specific intention for each study session to address the attention crisis. This was pertinent to address as many students say when they sat down to study they would experience "paralysis", feeling overwhelmed with the amount of tasks at hand. Further, having a sole target with one kanban board avoids having too many functionalities to fiddle and get distracted with. 




# Challenges with coding and development 
A lot of the road-blocks I experienced during the development of this project are documented within the code, where sections aren't functional. I made direct note to tutors to please give back feedback if possible - I would love to iterate and learn from these challenges I experienced. 

Other challenges that I experienced were mostly resolved with meetings with Rob Dongas and the workshop sessions - very grateful for the time and patience tutors have put in with me.

***Some final takeaways from this assignment are:***

- Time management, as there were a few funcitons I had to sacrifice due to limited time before the deadline.
- Understanding more about my learning styles (and time I require to understand and apply things) when in a realm outside of my comfort zone (for example, coding).
